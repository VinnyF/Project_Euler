This repository contains all of my solutions to problems from Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/
A collection of various problems in mathematics to be solved via programming.

I began solving these problems for two main reasons:
  1. To improve my programming skills on a more theoretical level.
  2. To learn new programming languages and apply what I've learned.

As I'm most comfortable in C++, I started with that, and then moved on to Haskell.
